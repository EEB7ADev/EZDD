# EZDD
An addon for SteamRE/DepotDownloader
<br>
**NOTE: This is not affiliated with ANYONE at SteamRE, nor is this a competitor to depot downloader. It is an ADDON to make things easier.**
<br>
Installation video Coming Soon!
<br>
This project is NOT released, it is public to test the updating functions
<br>
**TODO**
- [X] code a settings app
- [X] code a small feature that if you run a program by clicking on it rather than the main menu, when you exit it it will exit and not go to the main menu
- [X] Code an app that reverts the old steam game back to the new version
- [X] Flatten bugs
- [X] Code the Installation/upgrade
- [X] Test on another machine
- [] Release to V1.0

We are very close to V1, Here are some things I want to do before V1
<br>
**TODO**
<br>
- [] ~maybe removed the need for git?, If this works, I need to make a settings option called remove git.~ curl cant download whole repositorys
- [] ~move the files downloaded during installation to the appdata folder~
- [X] "small patches" which are small patches that arent release worthy. This will make the program copy files from the repo rather than from the installer package, you will be able to update to these patches from option 7. check for updates
- [] for the small patches, I realized I need to somehow make it so that once you install the patch, it doesnt say that there are patches available
- [] Create a settings option to manage the appdata folder
- [] create a settings option to reinstall dependencies
